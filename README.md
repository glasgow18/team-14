# Artlink (Team 14)

This application is called Discovery. It is designed to help disabled people to find proper activities according to individual preferences. It also can help carers to provide better care for them. They are able to use this application to browse resources related to activities and get useful infromation suggested by other users. The artists can also be involved in the app by generating a few ideas of activities.

The main requirements of this application are:
- Web-based and mobile-based APP 
- Filter by feature or by keyword
- Sharing messages columns
- Administration system for Artlink
- Search activities by Senses and Keywords
- Navigate users through the appropriate path

Team 14 (Github Commit Masters 2018 Winners) worked to create a prototype of this app in 20 hours of code.   

Some guidelines for the coders...

once you have your virtualenv installed run:        
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

after changing models:    
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
